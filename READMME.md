# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Introduction
Welcome to our AirBnB clone project - The Console! This project aims to create a command-line interface to manage AirBnB objects. It's the first step towards building a full web application for property rentals, following the AirBnB concept.

## Background Context
Before starting, please familiarize yourself with the AirBnB concept page. This project involves:
- Creating a parent class (`BaseModel`) for object initialization, serialization, and deserialization.
- Implementing a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Defining classes for AirBnB objects like User, State, City, Place, etc., all inheriting from `BaseModel`.
- Developing a file storage engine.
- Writing unit tests to validate all classes and storage engine.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/airbnb_clone.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash

    ```
